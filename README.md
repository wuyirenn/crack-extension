this extension is still under review from Google
credit: Natalie Ponte for a banger of a LinkedIn post this morning

if you want to run this locally, simply:
1. download the content.js and manifest.json files
2. put them in a folder
3. go to chrome://extensions/
4. toggle the developer mode in the upper right corner
5. lastly, select 'load unpacked' button in top left and select the folder

everything should work as intended, have fun
